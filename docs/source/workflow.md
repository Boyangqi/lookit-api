# Workflow: managing study states

## Why Transitions

[Transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) is an object-oriented state machine implemented in Python.

It's both very powerful and very simple. It's definition is a python dictionary so it can be easily serialized into JSON and stored in a database or configured via YAML. It has callback functionality for state transitions. It can create diagrams of the workflow using pygraphiz. It also ties into django model classes very easily.

## How

The workflow is defined in ``studies/workflow.py`` in a dictionary called ``transitions``. Here is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/cwisecarver/7335d99f04fa412a1004c72e2b979e34) that explains how the pieces fit together.


## Make a diagram

To make a workflow diagram in png format start a shell plus instance with ``python manage.py shell_plus`` and execute the following:

```python
# get a study you'd like to diagram
s = Study.objects.first()
# draw the whole graph ... in which case the study you choose doesn't matter
s.machine.get_graph().draw('fancy_workflow_diagram.png', prog='dot')
# ... or just the region of interest (contextual to the study you chose)
# (previous state, active state and all reachable states)
s.machine.get_graph(show_roi=True).draw('roi_diagram.png', prog='dot')
```

## Logging

There is a ``_finalize_state_change`` method on the ``Study`` model. It fires after every workflow transition. It saves the model with its updated ``state`` field and also creates a ``StudyLog`` instance making record of the transition. This callback would be the optimal place to add functionality that needs to happen after every workflow transition.
